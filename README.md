# Simple interpreter

This project is an attempt to create some simple interpreter of some simple language in educational and entertainment 
purposes.

Source code file suffix is .simple, bytecode file suffix is .simplec.  Currently, source code syntax and semantics seems 
an abnormal asm parody, just don't mind.  It's not programming language now.
